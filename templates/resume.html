        <p>
          Joined on day one as one of the first three employees to build a new bank for SMEs. Grew
          from engineer to Senior Staff, focusing primarily on payments infrastructure and interbank
          connectivity. Designed and implemented a distributed Core Banking System.
        </p>
        <p>
          Built connectivity to 10+ payment systems: from initial indirect SEPA through a partner
          bank to direct participation in EBA Clearing’s STEP2 and RT1, VISA card issuing as a
          principal member, European Central Bank systems, international wires through JP Morgan,
          and Swift services including messaging services, Universal Tracker, Payment Prevalidation,
          and FPAD anti-fraud. Passed the Swift Customer Security Programme certification. This
          infrastructure scaled from first customer transactions in 2020 to multi-billion euro
          monthly volume.
        </p>
        <p>
          Built team autonomy by documenting payment systems and enabling colleagues to handle
          complex testing cycles and production rollouts independently. Represented our bank
          externally, managing ongoing relationships with EBA Clearing and Swift.
